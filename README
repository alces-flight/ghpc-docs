## Reader Script

There is a ruby script called `ghpc-docs` that will list and read docs from `/opt/docs/` on the system.

## Docs Formatting

- Only files ending `.md` will be considered docs by the reader
- If a doc starts with a markdown H1 element then this title will be used as the display title in the docs list, otherwise a title will be fudged from the file name
- If a document is in a sub directory then that will be assumed to be the "Category" of the doc and will be displayed in square brackets before the doc in the list
